# Mind Memo
The project has a mobile Android App for patients to rate their day. This data is collected and uploaded to a Firebase server. The doctor will log into the website to view automatically generated reports about patients so he/she can plan a better treatment plan.  
The doctor will login via the login form. Patients will provide log how well they feel during the day into the Android app or iOS app (designed on Figma). The data will be generated into a report that doctors can view.
